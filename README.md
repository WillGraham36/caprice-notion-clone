## Why I Built This Project

From class notes and homeworks, to my calendar and project ideas, I use Notion to keep track of everything in my day-to-day life.

I created this project not only to test my technical skills, but also to add features to my favorite app that I wanted.

## What I learned 

One of the hardest features to implement was the main editor component. Originally, the editor was laggy since the backend was updated after every key pressed.
However, I made significant optimization refactors to make the user experience seamless to overcome this.

I learned a lot about creating full-stack applications, particularly with making API's that connect my front-end to the database. I learned a lot about creating these APIs using proper design and security practices
