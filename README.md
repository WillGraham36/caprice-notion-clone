## About Caprice

Caprice is a full-stack clone of Notion, including all notable features such as a working user authentification system, block-note editing, similar nested-like structure to storing notes, dark/light mode, and much more. 

I created this project to learn more about how larger, fullstack projects are created, as well as how to see a project to completion.
